Uebersicht an Patterns:

Point-to-Point Channel:
-ensures that only one receiver will receive a particular message
-if the channel has multiple receivers, only one of them can successfully consume a particular message
-if multiple receivers try to consume a single message, the channel ensures that only one of them succeeds, so the receivers do not have to coordinate with each other

Publish-Subscribe Channel:
-has one input channel that splits into multiple output channels, one for each subscriber
-when an event is published into the channel, the Publish-Subscribe Channel delivers a copy of the message to each of the output channels
-each output channel has only one subscriber, which is only allowed to consume a message once
=>each subscriber only gets the message once and consumed copies disappear from their channels

Aggregator:
-combines the results of individual, but related messages
-collect and store individual messages until a complete set of related messages has been received 
=>Aggregator publishes a single message, aggregated message to the output channel for further processing

Message Translator:
-systems using different data formats can communicate with each other using a special filter for messaging
-use a special filter, Message Translator, between other filters or applications to translate one data format into another

Channel Adapter:
-channel adapter can connect an application to the messaging system => it can send and receive messages
-channel adapter can access the application's API or data and publish messages on a channel based on this data, and that likewise can receive messages and invoke functionality inside the application

Message Endpoint:
-thorugh a Message Endpoint, an application can connect to a messaging channel to send and receive messages
-connect an application to a messaging channel using a Message Endpoint, a client of the messaging system that the application can then use to send or receive messages
